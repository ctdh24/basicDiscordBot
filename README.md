# basicDiscordBot
A basic dice rolling discord bot built using the tutorial from the [Dev Dungeon](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/javascript-discord-bot-tutorial) site by [nanodano](https://www.devdungeon.com/users/nanodano).

List of Commands: 
  * `!roll <some value in dice notation>`
    * Calculates a dice roll from [dice notation] format(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation)
      * `!roll 1d6+5` will generate a number between 1 and 6 and then add 5 to the result. 
      * `!roll 1d6+5x3`: This will do the same as above, but this will repeat 3 times.
